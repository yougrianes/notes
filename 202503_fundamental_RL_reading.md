RL fundamental concepts
----

1. markov decision processes are intented to include just three aspects, sensation, aaction and goal, a learning agent must be able to sense the state of its environment to some extent and must be able to take actions that affect the state. the agent also must have a goal or goals relating to the state of the environment.

2. reinforcement learning is trying to maximize a reward signal instead of trying to find hidden structure. Uncovering structure in an agent's experience can certainly be useful in reinforcement learning, but by itself does not address the reinforcement learning problem of maximizing a reward signal.

3. Q: what is the difference between rl and supervised / unsupervised learning?

4. the agent has to **exploit** what it has already experienced in order to obtain reward but it also has to **explore** in order to make better action selections in the future.
